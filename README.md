# AiChatBot
Chatbot is an AI chatbot that receives questions from users, tries to understand the question, and provides appropriate answers. It takes input from user , then going through relevant data by using pattern matching and gives a response to user. In other words, it answers your questions like a human does, instead of giving you the list of websites that may contain the answer. For this purpose, many open source platforms are available. Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) is derived from Extensible Markup Language (XML) which is used to build up a conversational agent (chatbot) artificially.
